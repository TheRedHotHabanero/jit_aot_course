# Task 2:
implement RPO and Dom tree analyses. You need to be able to traverse basic blocks into RPO order and to check
dominance of blocks and instructions.
+ fix mistakes from task 1

# Assignment 2 from slide:
* Implement DFS/RPO
* Implement dominator tree building
* Implement 3 unit tests

# Resources for task 2:
* [A fast algo...](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs528/handouts/a%20fast%20algorithm%20for%20finding.pdf)
* [Dominator tree of a directed graph](https://tanujkhattar.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/dominator-tree-of-a-directed-graph/)

# Task 3
Implement LoopAnalyzer + UT

# Resources for task 3:
[LLVM Loop terminology](https://llvm.org/docs/LoopTerminology.html)

# Assignment 3 from slide:
* Implement loop analyzer
* Implement tests from next 2 slides
